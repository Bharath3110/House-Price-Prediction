# House-Price-Prediction
This is a regression based project based off the data set for different housing features, we're going to try to predictthe price that a house should sell it.
So based on things like the number of bedrooms,no bathrooms, square footage, etc., we'll try to build a deep learning model that can actually predict the 
price of a house.
